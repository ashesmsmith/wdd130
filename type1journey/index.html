        <h1>Our Journey with Type 1 Diabetes</h1>
        <h2>How It All Started</h2>
        <p>Welcome! We are the Smith Family. Derek (dad), Ashley (mom), Tyler 
            and Elizabeth. We created this page to share our journey and life 
            living with Type 1 Diabetes. Derek and Tyler are the Type 1 diabetics 
            in our family but it affects us all in different ways.</p>
        <p>Our journey with Type 1 Diabetes started in June 2021, or April 2017, 
            depending on how you look at it. More on that in a minute. </p>
        <p>In June 2021, Derek and I began to notice symptoms of diabetes in our son. 
            He was starving and thirsty no matter how much he ate or drank, and he 
            started having frequent accidents at night which had never been a problem 
            for him before. We originally thought the accidents were because he was 
            drinking so much, and he was drinking a lot because it was a hot summer, 
            and he must be eating a lot because he was growing. After about a week of 
            this, we cut him off from water at around 6pm. Not long after he started 
            crying because his mouth felt dry and he was so thirsty. That's when realized 
            it must be something more. Derek had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes back 
            in April 2017 and his biggest symptom was excessive thirst. That night we 
            decided to test Tyler's blood sugar using Derek's meter. It read as 553! The 
            normal range is about 100 (give or take 20 points). We immediately headed to 
            the emergency room where they were about to test his blood sugar and a1c, as 
            well as give him some insulin. He was still 387 when we left the hospital but 
            we had an appointment with a pediatric endocrinologist for the next day. Fast 
            forward a couple months, after learning A TON of information about Type 1 Diabetes 
            (there's so much more to learn still) and learning the differences between Type 1 
            and Type 2, I began to get suspicious that Derek had been misdiagnosed because of 
            his age. Type 1 typically occurs in children and is often referred to as Juvenile 
            Diabetes. Derek was 30 when he was diagnosed. We decided to get him checked by a 
            specialist and sure enough in October 2021 he received an official diagnosis of Type 1 
            Diabetes (just a late onset). It was a miracle that he didn't have any major complications 
            from being diagnosed incorrectly as the treatment for these types is very different.</p>
