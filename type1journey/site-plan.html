        Our Journey with Type 1 Diabetes
        How It All Started
        
        Welcome! We are the Smith Family. Derek (dad), Ashley (mom), Tyler and Elizabeth. We created this page to share our journey and life living with Type 1 Diabetes. Derek and Tyler are the Type 1 diabetics in our family but it affects us all in different ways.

        Our journey with Type 1 Diabetes started in June 2021, or April 2017, depending on how you look at it. 
        More on that in a minute. 
        June 2021, Derek and I began to notice symptoms of diabetes in our son. He was starving and thirsty no matter how much he ate or drank, and he started having frequent accidents at night which had never been a problem for him before. We originally thought the accidents were because he was drinking so much, and he was drinking a lot because it was a hot summer, and he must be eating a lot because he was growing. After about a week of this, we cut him off from water at around 6pm. Not long after he started crying because his mouth felt dry and he was so thirsty. That's when realized it must be something more. Derek had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes back in April 2017 and his biggest symptom was excessive thirst. That night we decided to test Tyler's blood sugar using Derek's meter. It read as 553! The normal range is about 100 (give or take 20 points). We immediately headed to the emergency room where they were about to test his blood sugar and a1c, as well as give him some insulin. He was still 387 when we left the hospital but we had an appointment with a pediatric endocrinologist for the next day. Fast forward a couple months, after learning A TON of information about Type 1 Diabetes (there's so much more to learn still) and learning the differences between Type 1 and Type 2, I began to get suspicious that Derek had been misdiagnosed because of his age. Type 1 typically occurs in children and is often referred to as Juvenile Diabetes. Derek was 30 when he was diagnosed. We decided to get him checked by a specialist and sure enough in October 2021 he received an official diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes (just a late onset). It was a miracle that he didn't have any major complications from being diagnosed incorrectly as the treatment for these types is very different.

        August 13, 2022 - The Bike Trip that ended with an ER Visit

        What an adventure! Yesterday we set out with friends for a 2-day ride on the motorcycle but it ended up being one long day and a trip to the ER with Tyler. We are so thankful to have been with good friends that chose to take the long drive (although not as long as normal) at 11pm to get to the hospital with us.

        Details:
        Tyler was complaining his stomach hurt early in the afternoon but then ate lunch and seemed ok. Around 5:30pm, I got a call from my mom because he had been throwing up. Because he's Type 1 Diabetic, vomiting is a little scarier. We had my mom check ketones and double check his sugars with a finger poke to make sure the Dexcom was reading correctly. Ketones were trace or negative about 6pm and BG was pretty normal and not concerning. His head was hurting, so we settled on it being a migraine and him needing to rest and not have any more screen time.
        Fast forward a couple hours. Tyler is outside, has been napping and is going to try to eat some pizza. BG is still good. Must have been a migraine. We decide it's ok to go to the hot pools (Lava Hot Springs) and that he will probably be ok.
        We get done in the hot pools at Lava around 11pm and my mom calls as soon as I turn my phone back on. Tyler's throwing up again, can't even hold down water and ketones are now large. This is an automatic ER visit because things can get worse quick if we don't get fluids in him. DKA is scary and a big concern at this point. My mom hurries to get things ready to take him in. I called ahead to the ER gave his info and explained the situation. We go to the hotel grab our stuff and get on the road. 
        By the time we got there, he was on an IV, they were running blood tests and had given him something for the nausea. He was already starting to feel better and was watching the food channel and asking for food. He was a champ about the IV, it hurt and he cried but we were told he kept his arm straight the whole time and didn't move. This is a HUGE improvement compared to diagnose last year! He's come so far which both makes me proud and breaks my heart. Kirk and Kassie came in to visit with him and Kirk helped Derek give Tyler a blessing. Once all his tests came back, we talked with the doctor and we had caught everything fast enough that we were able to avoid DKA. His numbers were high and had we waited until morning things could have looked really different but thankfully everything was corrected quickly with IV fluids and whatever the nausea meds are called. He even got to finish out his sleepover at Grandma's and was awake bright and early full of energy!
        There are so many little miracles that happened on this trip making it possible for us to get back to Tyler quick. It would take way too long to list it all but we are so thankful!


        November 12, 2021 - Teaching Tyler's Class about Type Diabetes

        Today I had the opportunity to teach Tyler's class about diabetes and how to affects him. It was a really good experience and I probably stressed over it way more than I needed too. 
        It was so interesting to hear his classmates' questions and see how empathic they were towards him. I feel like it really helped Tyler embrace it more and not be so scared of people knowing. It also helped me remember how thankful I am for the advancements in medicine over the years. It's easy to get discouraged when we still have to give so many shots and be careful of so much but it really is amazing the technology we have now and I'm so thankful for it.


        October 6. 2021 - Derek's Official Type 1 Diagnosis and Tyler gets a Pump!

        We found out last week that Derek is actually Type 1 not Type 2. We start the journey of figuring out correct doses and changing a bunch of things for him next week. I really hope we can get it all figured out soon and get him feeling better. It's a miracle he hasn't had any major complications or worse in the last 4 years! Derek and Tyler have saved each other in this journey and we are so thankful!
        On a happier note, Tyler got his pump today! We had a 3-hour training first thing this morning to learn all about it. It's A LOT of information and there's a lot that has to be done just right but we are excited for him to have less pokes. He only needs one poke every 3 days for the pump and one about every 10 days for the CGM (unless we can make it last longer). Getting the port for the pump on him was rough because he was scared. It's a big weird setup with a needle, I was scared too. I had to lay on him to hold him down while he screamed and Derek put it on. He was really upset at first but I think he's already seeing the benefit. Tonight, we were talking about how he was able to eat whenever he wanted and he didn't have to get a shot. Then he told me that it kind of feels like the diabetes went away and this was the cure. I wish I could take the diabetes away for real but I'm so thankful that this technology is already helping him feel better. Now we just need Derek on it too.


        July 31. 2021 - Tyler Update

        We're just over a month in with this diabetes stuff now. Tyler is doing a lot better with it. He's starting to CHOOSE snacks that have carbs even though he knows he will need a shot for it. That's huge for us because he wasn't eating very much for a bit there. He isn't fighting us with shots very often anymore as long as he has "Cutie" his stuffed dragon (HUGE shot out to Aimee for the dragon, it was a perfect gift for him). He's even starting to get use to finger pokes. He let me do it yesterday for the first time without a fight. I'm thankful we don't have to do those very often because he has a CGM. Elizabeth has taken an interest in everything involving Tyler's care. She often checks his blood sugar and yells "44" or "88" every time regardless of what it actually is. She holds his hand, gets his dragon for him, helps pinch the area he needs the shot, and holds his clothing out of the way for us. She isn't bothered by the occasional blood and is quick to get a tissue to help clean up. She also gives us "shots" by pinching our arms and stabbing us with her razor-sharp finger nails. Maybe she'll be a nurse someday! 
        Overall, we are getting adjusted and things are going well. We are working on getting him a pump asap and crossing our fingers that we have it before school starts. 
        Thanks to everyone that has reached out and prayed for him! We appreciate you all.


        June 27. 2021 - Tyler's Diagnosis

        Over the last week we have noticed that Tyler has been showing symptoms of diabetes. We really hoped we were wrong because some of the symptoms overlap with the Autism and ADHD. Friday night we decided last minute to check his sugars using Derek's meter and he was at 553 (anything over 300 is very dangerous for a kid). We ended up going to the ER and he does have Type 1 Diabetes. It took wrapping him in a blanket and 5 adults holding him down to get an IV in. They were able to get him down to 387 with fluids and gave him some insulin before we left.
        Right now, we have lots of appointments, learning and adjustments but we are doing OK. He is scared and doesn't want to do all the shots. We know he will get used to it but right now it's hard and scary. We're angry and sad that he has to deal with this on top of the other things he's been diagnosed with in the last year (Autism, ADHD, Executive Processing Deficit and Anxiety) but we are also thankful to have caught it before the situation got worse.

        FAQ

        Q: What is the normal number for blood sugar?
        A: 100 give or take 20 points depending on when and what was last ate.

        Q: Do you have to change your diet? No more sugar?
        A: We don't have to change the diet as much as most people think. They can still have sugar, in fact carbohydrates convert to ‘sugars' that the body needs for energy. As long as they dose the right amount of insulin for what they are eating, they can have almost anything. The biggest exception is sugary drinks unless they are low and need to come back up.

        Q: What is DKA?
        A: Diabetic Ketoacidosis. It can be life-threatening if not treated correctly and quickly.

        Q: How did you know to check Tyler's blood sugar before diagnosis?
        A: Derek had been diagnosed as a Type 2 Diabetic (which we now know was wrong) and his biggest symptom was excessive thirst. It was the same for Tyler. There are several signs of Type 1 Diabetes which can be found in the graphic below (source JDRF). 

        Q: How are Type 1 and Type 2 different?
        A: Type 1 is an autoimmune disease with no cure at this time. The pancreas has stopped (or is starting to stop) producing insulin which is essential for the body. It is not brought on by lifestyle or eating too much sugar. Type 2 is not an autoimmune disease and varies in degrees of severity. It is often (not always) caused by lifestyle and diet. If caught early it can often be treated with medication and/or diet and sometimes goes away. Only some Type 2 patients require insulin whereas all Type 1 patients do or will require insulin.
