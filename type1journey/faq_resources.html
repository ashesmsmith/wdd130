                <p class="color"><strong>Q:</strong> What is the normal number for blood sugar?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> 100 give or take 20 points depending on when and what was last ate.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="color"><strong>Q:</strong> Do you have to change your diet? No more sugar?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> We don't have to change the diet as much as most 
                    people think. They can still have sugar, in fact 
                    carbohydrates convert to 'sugars' that the body 
                    needs for energy. As long as they dose the right 
                    amount of insulin for what they are eating, they can 
                    have almost anything. The biggest exception is sugary 
                    drinks unless they are low and need to come back up.</p>

                <p class="color"><strong>Q:</strong> What is DKA?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Diabetic Ketoacidosis. It can be life-threatening 
                    if not treated correctly and quickly.</p>

                <p class="color"><strong>Q:</strong> How did you know to check Tyler's blood sugar before 
                    diagnosis?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Derek had been diagnosed as a Type 2 Diabetic (which 
                    we now know was wrong) and his biggest symptom was 
                    excessive thirst. It was the same for Tyler. There are 
                    several signs of Type 1 Diabetes which can be found in 
                    the graphic below. (Graphic source JDRF)</p>
                <br>
                <p class="color"><strong>Q:</strong> How are Type 1 and Type 2 different?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Type 1 is an autoimmune disease with no cure at this 
                    time. The pancreas has stopped producing insulin (or will soon) which 
                    is essential for the body. It is not brought on by lifestyle or eating 
                    too much sugar.</p>
                <p>Type 2 is the most common and is not an autoimmune disease. It varies in 
                    degrees of severity and is often (but not always) caused by lifestyle 
                    and diet. If caught early enough, it be treated with 
                    medication and/or diet. Sometimes it even goes away! Only some 
                    Type 2 patients require insulin whereas all Type 1 patients 
                    do or will require insulin. (Graphic source JDRF)</p>
