            <h1>FAQ</h1>

            <p>Q: What is the normal number for blood sugar?</p>
            <p>A: 100 give or take 20 points depending on when and what was last ate.</p>

            <p>Q: Do you have to change your diet? No more sugar?</p>
            <p>A: We don't have to change the diet as much as most people think. They can still have sugar, in fact 
                carbohydrates convert to 'sugars' that the body needs for energy. As long as they dose the right amount 
                of insulin for what they are eating, they can have almost anything. The biggest exception is sugary drinks 
                unless they are low and need to come back up.</p>

            <p>Q: What is DKA?</p>
            <p>A: Diabetic Ketoacidosis. It can be life-threatening if not treated correctly and quickly.</p>

            <p>Q: How did you know to check Tyler's blood sugar before diagnosis?</p>
            <p>A: Derek had been diagnosed as a Type 2 Diabetic (which we now know was wrong) and his biggest symptom was 
                excessive thirst. It was the same for Tyler. There are several signs of Type 1 Diabetes which can be found 
                in the graphic below (graphic source JDRF).</p>

            <p>Q: How are Type 1 and Type 2 different?</p>
            <p>A: Type 1 is an autoimmune disease with no cure at this time. The pancreas has stopped (or is starting to stop) 
                producing insulin which is essential for the body. It is not brought on by lifestyle or eating too much sugar. 
                Type 2 is not an autoimmune disease and varies in degrees of severity. It is often (not always) caused by lifestyle 
                and diet. If caught early it can often be treated with medication and/or diet and sometimes goes away. Only some Type 
                2 patients require insulin whereas all Type 1 patients do or will require insulin. (graphic source JDRF)</p>
