    <h2>Ashley Smith</h2>

    <p>Hello! My name is Ashley Smith. I live in Idaho with my husband 
        and our 2 kids. I started homeschooling my kids this year and 
        between that, my own school work and the kids activites and 
        appointments we stay pretty busy. When I do have free time 
        (it's rare) I enjoy reading, playing video games, and going on 
        motorcycle rides with my husband. The motorcycle is my happy place 
        because it forces me to relax and enjoy the ride since I can't 
        do anything else.
    </p>

    <p>I am pursing a degree in Web Development because I love coding! 
        I first started learning to code in SQL when working as a 
        Data Specialist. I have a very basic knowledge of how coding works 
        but I have enjoyed learning more. I also hope that pursing this 
        path will make it possible to work from home doing something 
        I love while also being present for my kids as long as needed.  
    </p>
